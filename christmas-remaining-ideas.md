## Remaining Christmas Project Ideas

### 1. Gift Wrapping Simulator (Game)

- **Concept**: Time-based mini-game where players wrap presents of different sizes and shapes.
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Drag wrapping paper over boxes, align edges, and cut along guide lines.
  - Place tape pieces and bows; score based on neatness (alignment, overlap, symmetry) and speed.
  - Increasing difficulty with irregular box shapes and limited tape/paper.
- **Nice-to-Have Features**:
  - Multiple wrapping paper patterns and ribbon colors.
  - A “practice mode” with no timer and a “challenge mode” with combo scoring.
  - Simple scoring summary with stars and short feedback messages.

### 2. Santa’s Sleigh Navigation (Game)

- **Concept**: Arcade-style side scroller where Santa’s sleigh flies through the night sky collecting presents and avoiding obstacles.
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Keyboard controls (up/down/space) to move the sleigh and collect floating gifts.
  - Obstacles: clouds, chimneys, birds, and storm zones that reduce visibility.
  - Score combo for consecutive gifts without hitting obstacles.
- **Nice-to-Have Features**:
  - Simple level progression with increasing speed and obstacle density.
  - Power-ups (e.g., temporary shield, magnet for gifts, slow-motion).
  - End-of-run summary (distance traveled, gifts collected, best streak).

### 3. Christmas Word Search (Game)

- **Concept**: Classic word search with Christmas-themed vocabulary in English and Traditional Chinese.
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Generate a grid of letters with words placed horizontally/vertically/diagonally.
  - Click-and-drag (or tap-and-drag) to select words in the grid.
  - List of target words with bilingual labels.
- **Nice-to-Have Features**:
  - Multiple difficulty levels (grid size and word count).
  - Timer + best time tracking per difficulty.
  - Option to print or export puzzle as a static image/markdown.

### 4. Christmas Recipe Converter (Tool)

- **Concept**: Simple tool to scale holiday recipes up or down for different group sizes.
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Input: list of ingredients with quantity + unit + name (e.g., “200 g flour”).
  - Controls: original servings vs. desired servings; auto recompute all quantities.
  - Support for common units (g, kg, ml, L, cups, tbsp, tsp, pieces).
- **Nice-to-Have Features**:
  - Preset sample recipes (e.g., cookies, hot chocolate, stuffing) for quick demo.
  - Toggle between metric and imperial units with approximate conversions.
  - “Shopping list” mode: aggregate ingredient totals across multiple recipes.

### 5. Holiday Playlist Generator (Tool)

- **Concept**: Helper tool to design a balanced holiday playlist (not an actual music player).
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Define categories (classic, modern pop, instrumental, kids) and desired proportions.
  - Pre-filled example tracks (title + artist) per category as suggestions.
  - Generate a randomized ordered list of tracks matching the category mix.
- **Nice-to-Have Features**:
  - Export playlist as plain text/markdown for copy-paste into streaming apps.
  - “Mood presets” (chill, party, family-friendly) that adjust category weights.
  - Simple duplication-avoidance and shuffle button.

### 6. Christmas Card Generator (Tool)

- **Concept**: Web-based generator for simple e-cards with custom messages.
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - Card layout with a few templates (tree, snowman, lights, nativity, neutral).
  - Inputs: recipient name, short message, sender name, language (EN/繁體中文).
  - Render final card on canvas or in a styled div; allow download as PNG or print view.
- **Nice-to-Have Features**:
  - Color theme selector (red/green, blue/silver, minimal white, kawaii pastels).
  - Random “extra line” suggestions (e.g., short blessings or quotes) per locale.
  - Option to generate multiple cards in a grid for printing on A4/Letter.
